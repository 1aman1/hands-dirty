***

One stop to revive coding basics and for retuning datastructures and algorithms.

A. Content Structure of each directory
   * Book Problems
   * LEETCODE
   * practice & implementations. 
   
B. Data Structures
   * Array & String
   * Stack
   * Linkedlist
   * Tree
   * Heaps
   * Trie
   * Graph
   * Bit Manipulation

C. More topics like
   * Mathematics
   * Queues
   
***

For the above listed data structures, select it's branch and then it's directory to see the latest progress and respective implementations.

__It is always helpful if you register an edgecase malfunction/issue seen in any part of this code-road.__
